Last week I had got a call from my ex girl friend.We had meet after 10 years. I feel very happy and nostalgic.
I have seen a flower which changes its color two times in a day. When the flower when it grown it is white color and in the afternoon it is baby pink and in the evening it is dark pink. I liked it  very much its plant also very good daily we can get more flowers
I felt very good at this occasion. This was some festive occasion. I was looking pretty and some of the girls living in our area where staring me for long. I love the way they were staring on me. They liked me and one of them wants to propose me.
It was right after a meditation session. I finished meditating on my house roof. When I opened my eyes, everything looked very beautiful and pure. I moved my eyes around, saw plants and green leaves, blue sky with clouds, buildings, furniture and everything looked so beautiful. It was like the world is a beautiful place and we are blessed to have it.
My experience was when i saw my partner and gone love proposal. Last 3 months before i proposed my love to my lover and she get very shy feel and i also. The place where forest area with elephants are presented and birds sounds are awesome environment for me and i got very very pieceful location and well.

"The moment was when my first ever smartphone arrives. I was in school at the time. It was based on my own personal savings and I am a techno geek. You can probably feel my excitement. Also, it was the most popular and expensive phone of the time. I was super excited to have it. It felt like not waiting for anyone, just opening the box and using it right away.

It was delivered as a parcel from Amazon, the person came to send the parcel also told me to calm down as he saw the level of excitement I was having. 

I immediately asked my parents for permission to open the phone and use it."
We went to temple in Thanjavur. I was very impressed with the intricate detailing. The temple was enormous. I felt really connected with the temple. I couldn't get enough of it. I could still smell the unique temple smell. There were so many sculptures.
When i was seven year old, i went to the temple and run away from the temple. My parents were finding many hours but they cannot found me. After several hours my parents found me. They were happy. I was very panic at that time. But still this was interesting and wonderful experience for me.
I was doing my college first year. I saw one handsome man stand infront of my department who does not belongs to my department. Both see each other and he fall in for me. I also do. Life was so beautiful when we love each other. we got married and have daughter. But being lover to him was most beautiful and very pleasant memories of me. 
I went to one perfume factory at the time the truck came to deliver the load of flowers and I was amazed to see all those together with some great smell and I was really surprised and I'm able to remember for a long time. 
The experience that I was with nature 2 years back I went for a trip with my friend at forest ,The camp at beside of waterfalls almost 5 days trip I feel high and such a beauty in life the atmosphere from the hills and from the waterfalls, two days rain it feel Mee touching soul. I get very high quality days in attachment with nature .. remaining social days and events are just normal not specifically interested.

Once upon a time I had worked. At the time I had very happy and with my friends. That the experience very beauty experience for my life. We are worked in enjoy and hard work. We are celebrate all events. That a happy life not forgot. I currently image and the oldest themes.
"In my life i was traveled to my native town through plane and i was flying at high altitude.
Shining of Clouds was wonderful, amazing. I took lot of photos through plane window.Natural sky blue was beautiful."
i like beauty. i am going to friend marriage. yesterday  i am going to beauty center. beautician done eye brow and facial . i like beautiful this moment. some makeup done
I was holidaying in Switzerland. It was early spring and I was with my wife. We were going to Mt. Titlis. We walked to the cable car station from the railway station. There were gurgling streams on the way, fresh green grass, colourful flowers and snowcapped mountains in the distance. The birds were chirping and the chill in the air was just about comfortable. The sun was gentle and provided enough warmth so as to not feel cold. That walk was one of the most scenic and beautiful sight I have experienced in my life.
"I don't know whether this is a beautiful experience or not but I always remember and cherish this experience when I feel low, depressed and blue. I guess love is one of the most beautiful experiences in the world. Your first love when you get flat seeing that girl makes you numb, time stops moving, you can't sense, you can't breath as if your heart stops pumping blood. This happened 20 years back when I was in high school and there was a girl and she and I were at the same school from kindergarten onwards. For others, she is just an average girl but for me, she is an angel in disguise. I always had a soft corner for her but did not have the gut to approach her. The situation changed and after so many years in high school, I approached her intentionally asking for assistance with the projects and she obliged and helped me dearly in each and every way possible. Whenever I was with her, I lost my senses as if I am not sober, I became intoxicated whenever she was around me. After 10 or 12 meetings we agreed for a cup of tea. It was raining and she took the cup in her hand to feel the warmth and the way she sipped her tea, it is as if it was yesterday though it happened 20 years back. I am in nostalgia.

Thanks for creating this post so that I can write something which was only in my mind but now it in the post."
The most beautiful scene I've ever seen is a lion feeding its cubs .The most wonderful food I've ever tasted.
I had beautiful memory when i was 15 years old girl. I went to tour with my family. I was very enjoyed that time. I spend lot of time with my family. We smiled a lot and danced each other. We shared the food each other. This was the beautiful memory.
The beauty experience I felt was when me and my friends visited a hilltop tourist place. The place was thousands of feets above sea level. The journey took half a day to reach that place. The place was so beautiful that every one stunned . The nature made that place like a heaven. The road was good and all the roadsides  are greenish and full of flowers. At top the temperature was cold.   All the area surrounding that place can be seen tiny in a distant view. The clouds look like they are going to touch our head. The sunset view was a beautiful view that we never gonna forget. 
when my marriage date fixed ,i decided to go to the beauty parlour, at that place i feel the different and pleasant smell,after complete the facial process , i felt fresh and looking better than before, that was the great feeling of mine. 
one day that was my birthday.i was fight with my dad because he cannot buy any chocolate,dress,gifts.i was felt so bad.so shouting loudly.then i go to college.  fullday i cannot in right mood.that evening it was 5 o clock.one car comming to me and pickup to the 5star hotel.all friends and family members are there that place.my dad was waiting for me.he come to me happy birthday baby and you are gifted to me i am sorry babes.that minute i was so happy memorable day and moment.
always i am person who loves travel and be with others in my entire life i never thought much about general people or the society as whole it may because of my life style. but, few years back when i was in my earlier days of college one of my friend got injured in a road accident. and we admitted him in a hospital at that time we don't know his background or family status(financial). when we know about his situations and how hard time he is facing we felt immensely bad so, we decided to help him upon the help of our college friends we helped for his medical treatment after few months he recovered. when i saw his mother he thanked me from her heart which makes me heart broken till that time i never interested or even thought about other life or their issues i only think about my life and passion at the time when i saw her eyes i came to know the meaning of real happiness. this incident diverted my life in different way even still now we formed a NGO to help needy people. and, finally in my personal opinion there's nothing is great other than fulfill a persons dream

And correctly identify for me. They very happy and me happy. I like very much. My home happy for the babies reason for only.

This is from a few years back when I went trekking in the Himalayas. After braving the weather for a few days, I felt that I was coming down with a cold and decided to stay in for a day. My Nepali hosts were very courteous. Later that evening, knowing that I was unwell, the mother of the house went out of her way to grab some herbs to make a locally used medicinal concoction. I didn‚Äôt quite expect that and I was quite moved by their generosity. About a week later, there was I was, making my way across one of the highest passes in the world. Physically it was brutal, but it‚Äôs a moment that‚Äôs going to stay with me forever. 
"It happened a few years ago, 2017 March to be exact. I and my friends decided to visit Taj Mahal which is located just outside the city of Agra in Uttar Pradesh, India. 

It is true artwork and was very fascinating to me. The true symbol of love in front of my eyes, I was in fact mesmerized how you can spot the optical effects of marbles throughout the building. As I walking around I felt a sense of mystery and excitement over how I was able to fulfill my long term wish.

I still remember the place very vividly in my mind. I hope to visit Taj Mahal again sometime in the future.
